# Business Problem:
Analyze the data and generate insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries

Based on the data analysis, it's recommended that Netflix should focus on below countries for the content with the rating â€“ TV-MA, TV-14, R, PG-13, TV-PG & PG as itâ€™s available for most general audiences and doesnâ€™t restrict it to certain ages. United States, India, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea. As more TV shows are being released each year, it suggests that its overall popularity is increasing, hence along with movies, Netflix needs to produce more tv shows. While doing that, specific attention needs to paid towards the genre of the content, the most popular genres are - International Movies, Dramas, Documentaries, Comedies, Action & Adventure, Children & Family Movies. 

Specific observations, approach to the case study are provided in the python notebook, thanks.
